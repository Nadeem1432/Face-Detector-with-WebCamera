Algorithm for a Face Detector with opencv 


step1 - Start 
step2 - Import Modules
step3 - capture screen by webcamera
step4 - take a cascade classifier ( here we use haarcascade)
step5 - Starting a loop for detecting screen for face in every second.
step6 - Now detect with detectMultiScale()
step7 - play a beep sound when face is detected
step8 - Now create a folder by os module and save the faces that detected by detector
step9 - set a key for break the loop and destroy the all screens.
atep10 - End
